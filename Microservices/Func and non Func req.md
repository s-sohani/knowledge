### **Functional Requirements**

These describe the specific behaviors, features, and functions of the application. They are what the system should do.

1. **Core Application Features**:
    
    - User authentication and authorization (login, signup, roles, permissions).
    - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data entities.
    - Business logic and workflows (e.g., order processing, transaction handling).
    - Integration with third-party services (APIs, payment gateways, etc.).
2. **Data Requirements**:
    
    - Data input, processing, and validation.
    - Storage and retrieval mechanisms.
    - Reporting and analytics.
3. **User Interface**:
    
    - Layouts, forms, and navigation.
    - Accessibility (e.g., support for screen readers).
    - Internationalization (support for multiple languages).
4. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Meaningful error messages and recovery options.
    - Logging and exception management.
5. **Communication**:
    
    - Notifications (email, SMS, push).
    - Chat or collaboration features if required.
6. **Compliance**:
    
    - Adherence to domain-specific regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

These define how the system performs under certain conditions and its quality attributes.

1. **Performance**:
    
    - Response times (e.g., sub-second for critical operations).
    - Throughput (number of transactions per second).
    - Scalability (horizontal/vertical scaling capabilities).
2. **Reliability**:
    
    - Uptime and availability (e.g., 99.99% uptime).
    - Failover mechanisms and disaster recovery.
3. **Security**:
    
    - Data encryption (in-transit and at-rest).
    - Secure authentication (e.g., OAuth, multi-factor authentication).
    - Protection against vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
4. **Usability**:
    
    - Intuitive design and user experience.
    - Learning curve for new users.
5. **Maintainability**:
    
    - Modular architecture for easier updates.
    - Detailed documentation and coding standards.
6. **Compatibility**:
    
    - Cross-platform support (e.g., web, mobile, desktop).
    - Browser and device compatibility.
7. **Scalability**:
    
    - Support for increasing user base or data volume.
    - Cloud-native solutions or containerization for deployment flexibility.
8. **Portability**:
    
    - Ability to move the system across environments without significant rework.
9. **Compliance**:
    
    - Adherence to technical standards (e.g., ISO, PCI-DSS).
    - Auditing capabilities for regulatory requirements.
10. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    
    - Real-time monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
    - Log aggregation and analysis (e.g., ELK stack).
11. **Cost**:
    
    - Budget constraints for development and operational expenses.
    - Optimization for cloud or infrastructure costs.
12. **Environmental Constraints**:
    
    - Limitations on hardware, software, or network bandwidth.
    - Offline or low-bandwidth operation capabilities.

### Example of How These Work Together

If you're building an e-commerce platform:

- **Functional requirements**: Product catalog, shopping cart, payment integration, order tracking.
- **Non-functional requirements**: Fast page load times (<1 second), secure payments (SSL/TLS encryption), scalable architecture to handle Black Friday traffic, and an intuitive interface for mobile users.

By addressing both sets of requirements during planning and design, you create a well-rounded and effective application.
