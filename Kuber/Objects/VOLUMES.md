Pods is logical hosts that use  be shared resources like CPU and RAM, but storage can't be used share. so a pod has its own isolated filesystem. a volume is created when the pod is started and is destroyed when the pod is deleted. Because of this, a volumeâ€™s contents will persist across container restarts. After a container is restarted, the new container can see all the files that were written to the volume by the previous container. Also, if a pod contains multiple containers, the volume can be used by all of them at once. A volume is available to all containers in the pod, but it must be mounted in each container that needs to access it.
In Linux and Kubernetes can mounting the same volume into two or more containers in a pod.
