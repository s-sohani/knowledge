Understanding internal storage mechanisms helps developers choose and tune the appropriate storage engine for their applications. The chapter will explore storage engines optimized for transactional versus analytical workloads, starting with traditional relational and most NoSQL databases, specifically examining log-structured and page-oriented storage engines like B-trees.

# Data Structures That Power Your Database
A simple database can be implemented with two Bash functions: `db_set` to append key-value pairs to a file, and `db_get` to retrieve the latest value for a key by scanning the file. This approach is efficient for appending data but inefficient for lookups, as it requires scanning the entire file. Efficient data retrieval requires indexes, which provide metadata to locate data quickly. Indexes speed up read queries but slow down writes, necessitating careful selection based on query patterns to balance performance and overhead.
